# Assignment:
```c
  HealthJoy : "fork a repo"
```

### Generate a Github token

* [Link Here](https://github.com/settings/tokens)


### Starting the server via docker-compose
```c
    docker-compose up -d --build
```


### Stopping the server via docker-compose:
```c
    docker-compose down -v    
```

### Creating a Fork
* Once you have the token, go [here](/sub)

### Design considerations
* If I'd had more than a night to work on this I'd probably would have used Oauth and worked on the frontend a little more.
